## 💬 Margaret's Actual Concerns (From Interview)

> "I don't even know what half those words mean"

> "Are we screwing this up?"

## 🚫 Questions to Avoid in Demo

These are too technical for Margaret:

❌ "What's our Sharpe ratio and how does it compare to the S&P 500?"
❌ "Should we rebalance our asset allocation quarterly?"
❌ "What's the alpha of our equity manager?"

Keep it simple, keep it real!

**Instead of just typing silently, SAY:**

> "Let me show you what Margaret, a trustee I interviewed, would ask..."

> "Here's a real concern trustees have..."

> "This is the kind of question that keeps board members up at night..."

Makes it feel human, not robotic.
