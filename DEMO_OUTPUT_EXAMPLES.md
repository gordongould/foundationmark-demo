### Text Output (Markdown Formatted):

## Your Foundation: Healthy ✅

You're giving out **$1.5M per year** from a **$30M foundation**. That's exactly **5%** - right where you should be according to IRS requirements.

### The Bottom Line
You're doing well. Your foundation can sustain its current grant-making indefinitely, and you have room to give more if you choose.

### Why you're in good shape
- Your portfolio is expected to earn **7.2% annually**
- You only need **5%** to cover grants
- That **2.2% cushion** protects you during down markets
- You rank in the **top 35%** of similar foundations

### One thing to consider
You could safely increase your grants by **$200K-300K per year** and still maintain a healthy foundation.

## Short Answer: Yes, You Can Give More ✅

You could safely increase your annual grants by **$200,000 to $300,000** while maintaining a healthy foundation.

### Here's the Math
**Current situation:**
- Foundation assets: **$30M**
- Annual grants: **$1.5M** (5%)
- Expected portfolio return: **7.2%**

**The cushion:**
- You earn: **7.2%** = $2.16M per year
- You give: **5%** = $1.5M per year
- Cushion: **2.2%** = $660K per year

### Why Not Give It All?
You need that cushion for:
- **Down years** - When markets drop 10-20%
- **Inflation** - Your grants should grow over time
- **Long-term sustainability** - Protecting future generations

### Conservative Approach
Increase grants by **$200K-$250K** this year. That gives you:
- **Total grants:** $1.7M-$1.75M (5.7-5.8%)
- **Still safe cushion:** 1.4-1.5%
- **Peer-typical:** Most foundations give 5.5-6%

### Your Decision
Talk to your board about:
1. Increasing to **$1.75M annually** (5.8%)
2. Or creating a **special initiative fund** ($200K one-time)
3. Or planning a **3-year ramp-up** to $1.8M
```

## You'd Be OK, But Would Need to Watch Spending 🔶

If the stock market crashed **30%** tomorrow, your foundation would survive - but you'd need to make some adjustments.

### What Would Happen

**Immediate impact:**
- Foundation value drops from **$30M → $21M**
- Your $1.5M grants now represent **7.1%** payout (high)
- You'd be dipping into principal

**Not the end of the world because:**
- You have **2+ years of grant money** in bonds/cash
- Markets typically recover in 18-24 months
- Your diversified portfolio limits the damage

### What You Should Do

**Year 1 (crash year):**
- Keep grants at $1.5M (honoring commitments)
- Pause any new multi-year commitments
- Don't panic-sell stocks

**Year 2-3 (recovery):**
- Reduce grants to $1.2-1.3M temporarily (5% of new value)
- Wait for recovery
- Rebalance as markets improve

**Historical perspective:**
During 2008 financial crisis, foundations that stayed disciplined:
- Were back to pre-crisis levels by 2012-2013
- Those who panic-sold took 7-10 years to recover

### Your Protection
Your current allocation (60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% alternatives) is designed for this:
- **Bonds** provide steady income during stock crashes
- **Alternatives** often move differently than stocks
- **Time** is your friend - foundations are long-term

### Bottom Line
A market crash would be uncomfortable but not catastrophic. Your diversified portfolio and conservative payout rate protect you.

## Technical Implementation

Each AI response will include:
```json
{
  "visualType": "health-check" | "performance" | "peer-comparison" | "calculator" | "scenario" | "none",
  "data": {
    // Chart-specific data structure
  },
  "markdown": "The formatted text response"
}
```

The frontend will:
1. Render markdown text with `react-markdown`
2. Show appropriate chart/card based on `visualType`
3. Layout text + visual side-by-side (desktop) or stacked (mobile)
